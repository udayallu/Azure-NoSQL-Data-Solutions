# Document-Based NoSQL Stores
- A Document-based NoSQL store is a special type of database that extends the functionality found in a typical key-value NoSQL store.
-  In a document store, you can perform operations and queries based on the keys or values
-  Each item in the database is itself a collection of key-value pairs.
- This collection is essentially referred to as a "document" and it can be queried or modified in an interactive manner.
- Documents can have child documents embedded directly within them.
- These embedded documents can also be queries in the same manner.\

## Azure Cosmos DB
- Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft's new globally distributed, multi-model database service.
- Azure Cosmos DB offers a turn-key database service that allows you to create a database and distribute the data globally so that the data users access or in datacenters closer to them.

#### The JSON documents stored in Azure Cosmos DB are managed through a well-defined hierarchy of database resources. These resources are automatically replicated to ensure that they are highly available while still allowing you to address each resource using a unique URI.
- The basic hierarchy structure is detailed in the following diagram:
